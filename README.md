# KenzieHub

This academic project consists of an interface that aims to assist users in organizing their studies. By registering on the platform, users can access their profile page and add the technologies they are studying, as well as track their progress over time.

One of the main features of the platform is the secure login, which allows users to quickly and easily access their profile page. Upon logging in, users are directed to the platform's home page, which displays the registered technologies and their progress in a clear and organized format.

To ensure the best user experience, the platform uses React's Context API to manage the application's states. In addition, integration with the API provided by the educational institution allows for relevant and up-to-date information about the registered technologies, making the progress tracking process even more efficient.

In summary, the developed platform offers a practical and efficient solution for users who want to organize their studies and track their progress in a clear and objective way. With a secure login and intuitive features, the platform is an essential tool for those seeking to improve their academic and professional performance.
